# Collapsible Sidebar

A responsive and animated **collapsible sidebar component** built with plain **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This sidebar can be used in dashboards, admin panels, or any web project where you need a clean and functional navigation menu.  

The sidebar includes a **logo placeholder**, a set of navigation links with icons, and a **toggle button** to collapse/expand it.  
On desktop, it collapses into a compact sidebar with only icons. On mobile, it slides in/out for a better user experience.
